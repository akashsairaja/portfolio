# Migration Summary: React Scripts to Vite

## Requirements Addressed

1. **Support for Latest Node.js**
   - Updated package.json to be compatible with Node.js 18.x and later
   - Removed dependencies with known compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions
   - Added "type": "module" to enable ES modules

2. **Removed React Scripts**
   - Completely removed react-scripts dependency
   - Replaced with Vite for a more modern and faster development experience

3. **Added Vite Support**
   - Added Vite and related dependencies
   - Created vite.config.js with appropriate configuration
   - Created a new index.html in the root directory
   - Updated import syntax to be compatible with Vite

4. **Kept All Commands Running**
   - Maintained similar commands with Vite equivalents:
     - `npm run dev` (replaces `npm start`)
     - `npm run build` (same as before but uses Vite)
     - Added `npm run preview` for previewing the production build

5. **Updated Dependencies**
   - React and React DOM to v18.2.0
   - react-router-dom to v6.20.0
   - Bootstrap to v5.3.2
   - Replaced node-sass with sass

## Files Changed

1. **package.json**
   - Updated dependencies and scripts
   - Added "type": "module"

2. **New Files Created**
   - vite.config.js
   - index.html (in root directory)
   - MIGRATION.md (documentation)

3. **Code Updates**
   - src/index.jsx: Updated React Router and ReactDOM usage
   - src/config/index.js: Updated image imports
   - src/scss/style.scss: Updated SCSS imports

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Performance**
   - Faster development server startup
   - Faster hot module replacement
   - Better build performance

2. **Modern JavaScript**
   - ES modules by default
   - Better tree-shaking
   - Improved code splitting

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Simpler configuration
   - Better error messages
   - More extensible plugin system

4. **Future-Proofing**
   - Better support for newer Node.js versions
   - Active development and community support
   - Easier to adopt new React features

## Next Steps

The application should now be ready to run with Vite. After installing dependencies with `npm install`, you can start the development server with `npm run dev` or create a production build with `npm run build`.

Refer to the README.md and MIGRATION.md files for more detailed instructions and information about the changes made.
